# DSA-Java-Practise

Welcome to DSA-Java-Practise! This project aims to document popular data structures and algorithms in programming using Java code.  It serves as a practical resource to kickstart learning and practicing common DSA concepts.

## Key Features

* **Clear and Concise Code:**  Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in Java with clear explanations and comments.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** The project covers a wide range of fundamental data structures and algorithms.
* **Practical Examples:**  Code examples demonstrate how to use each data structure and algorithm effectively.
* **Easy to Navigate:** The project is organized with individual README files for each data structure, making it easy to find what you're looking for.
