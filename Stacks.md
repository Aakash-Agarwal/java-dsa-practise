## Stacks

- A stack data structure arranges data in a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order.
- The data may or may not be stored in contiguous memory blocks.
- During retrieval, the last item inserted into the stack is returned.
- A "Head" pointer in a stack always points to the last element's index.

**Time Complexity**

- Get: O(1)
- Insert or Update: O(1)
- Search: Not applicable (typically not a search-oriented data structure)

**Example with Code**
